## Design Choices ##

Cherry shrimps originate from the freshwater streams of Taiwan, so the Logo (Shrimp Royale), is loosely inspired by East Asian Kawaii and Taiwanese calligraphy.  

## Wireframes ##

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). To produced **lo-fi** wireframes just to get a guideline and so I could get a better **feeling** for what would go where and how things would look on different screen sizes.

Wireframes in order:\
Mobile view  
Tablet view  
Desktop view
